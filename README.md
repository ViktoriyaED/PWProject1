## Key Notes

### Framework Design

#
### Test Design
- Each test in the [tests package](./src/test/java/) is independent and complete.
- [BaseTest](./src/test/java/BaseTest.java) class uses the TestNG configuration annotations for set up and tear down.
    - **@BeforeClass** : clean up results directory, Initialize the extent reports, logger and read test properties.
    - **@BeforeMethod** : Start the playwright server, instantiate the page and navigate to the website.
    - **@AfterMethod** : Stop the tracing (if enabled), close the page instance.
    - **@AfterClass** : This method used in each Test class to close the browser and the playwright server.
- For each Test new playwright server is launched which is isolated from other playwright instance.

#
### Test Execution 
- The tests can be executed from maven test command or individual TestNG test from local after cloning the repo.
- maven commands
     ```command
     
       mvn clean test                                    / To run all the unit tests

       mvn test -Dtest=testClasseName                    / To run a single test class

       mvn test -Dtest=testClasseName#testMethodName     / To run a specific methods within test classes

     ```
- The tests can be executed uses *TestNG* as the test runner.
       
#
### Reporting
To see the report, go to the 
- target/surefire-reports/index.html                (OR) 
- target/surefire-reports/emailable-report.html

#
### GitHub Actions
- Workflow: workflow_dispatch is used in workflow, so the test can be executed triggered from actions ui
By default, the test will be executed on Ubuntu runner with headless mode.
